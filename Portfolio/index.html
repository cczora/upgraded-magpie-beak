				<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
				<img src="Images/ccz-portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait of Cody Czora">
				<p>I am an aspiring software developer living in Champlin, Minnesota with my fiance and two cats.</p>
				<p>I have a history of working in the medical laboratory field, and recently made the decision to switch careers fields and move to the technology sector.
			I hope to bring my medical experience to bear in making great software and websites to organizations around the country!</p>

				<p id="target">
				I worked for four years as a certified Medical Laboratory Scientist for the Fairview Health Services network, and most recently worked one year for Memorial Blood Centers performing advanced laboratory testing and blood banking work.
				I have been published in the scientific journal <a href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/6/7/1891"> G3 | Genes, Genomes, Genetics</a>.
				</p>
				<p>I felt that these experiences gave me valuable communication skills, attention to detail, and multitasking ability,
				and I hope to apply them to my future career in technology.</p>
