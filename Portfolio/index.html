				<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
				<p>I am an aspiring software developer living in Champlin, Minnesota with my fiance and two cats.</p>
				<p>I have a history of working in the medical laboratory field, and recently made the decision to switch careers fields and move to the technology sector.
			I hope to bring my medical experience to bear in making great software and websites to organizations around the country!</p>

				<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
				<p>
				I worked for four years as a certified <strong>Medical Laboratory Scientist</strong> for the Fairview Health Services network, and most recently worked one year for Memorial Blood Centers performing advanced laboratory testing and blood banking work.
				I take pride in the fact that I was published in the scientific journal G3 | Genes, Genomes, Genetics in college. Please visit the "About Me" page to learn more!
				</p>
				<p><span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">I felt that these experiences gave me valuable communication skills, attention to detail, and multitasking ability,
				and I hope to apply it to a future career in technology someday.</span></p>

				<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
				<p>When not working, I enjoy being physically active through yoga and walking. I a playing with my cats, and playing computer games such as Minecraft.</p>
				<p>I especially love learning whatever I can about the scientific and natural world, whether that be through watching documentaries, reading non fiction books, or watching informative YouTube videos.</p>
